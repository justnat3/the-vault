# vault-todo

### Somethings that we should look into implementing
[]  add windows support for vault

[]  parsing for "projects" DirEntries - this would give us support for like catagories


[]  have vault be agnostic to ".md" extentions on files. This should allow like syntax
    highlighting and other nice extension based features
