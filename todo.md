# vault-todo

### Somethings that we should look into implementing
[]  add windows support for vault
[]  parsing for "projects" DirEntries - this would give us support for like catagories
[]  being able to link (symlink) READMEs from projects to store in vault.
    or really any file that you don't want to store directly in vault
    this would have to be a pre-existing file to link in vault but non the less
    a nice feature

[]  have vault be agnostic to ".md" extentions on files. This should allow like syntax
    highlighting and other nice extension based features

[] https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html
    some bash completetion?

[] implement a search function
